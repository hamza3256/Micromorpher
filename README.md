# Leftover Foreign Currency (LFC)

This is a repository for coding the Leftover Foreign Currency application.

The initial goal is to take currency exchange rates, for example, Euros (EUR) to British Pounds (GBP), and put them on an Ethereum blockchain. That gives an immutable history of those rates and should serve as the basis for an LFC app'.

Then, User A is going to exchange their leftover Euros for GBP with User B, who has posted an exchange rate just below the offical rate.
