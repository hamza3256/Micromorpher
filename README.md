# Micromorpher

This is the repository for **Micromorpher**, a demo of an early prototype distributed application (dApp) for converting small amounts of fit currency (GBP) into Ether, using blockchain smart contracts.

**Micromorpher** is the result of the academic paper called, [Towards a post-cash society: An application to convert fiat money into a cryptocurrency](http://dx.doi.org/10.5210/fm.v22i3.7410), by Steve Huckle, Martin White and Rituparna Bhattacharya, of the [University of Sussex Informatics Department](http://www.sussex.ac.uk/informatics/).

## Installing Locally

The instruction below enable you to run **Micromorpher** on a local, private, Ethereum test network (via [Ganache](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache)).

### Getting Started

After cloning this repository, install the prerequisites listed and follow the instructions below to get the project up and running on your local machine (for development and testing purposes).

### Prerequisites

After cloning this repository, download and install the dependencies (if you have not already done so):

- [node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Ganache](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache)
- [Truffle](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle)
- [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)

### Install

Follow the instructions in the [Ganache](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache) repository for downloading and installing Ganache; tl;dr - you need to clone the [Ganache](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache) repository, then run `npm install && npm start`.

In the **Micromorpher** repository's home directory, type `npm install`. That should install everything listed in [package.json](/package.json), which form the components of the REACT-based web frontend to this application.

Now, publish the contracts to your local blockchain (via [Ganache](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache)):

1. Change directory to the [Ganache](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache) repository.
2. Start [Ganache](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache) by typing `npm start`.
3. Ensure [Ganache](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache) is running on [http://localhost:8545](http://localhost:8545) (you may need to change its settings to do so).
4. Change to the **Micromorpher** repository's home directory.
5. Change to the **Micromorpher** directory [/blockchain/contracts](/blockchain/contracts), and type `truffle migrate`.
6. Edit the **Micromorpher** source file [/app/utils/contractHandler.jsx](/app/utils/contractHandler.jsx) so that the contract static variables contain the addresses generated by `truffle migrate`, above.

Now create the web application:

1. Change to the **Micromorpher** repository's home directory.
2. Build the REACT frontend by typing `npm run watch`.
3. Copy some needed resources to the build directory by typing `npm run copy`.
4. Startup an instance of [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) by typing `npm run start`.

Then fire up a browser and go to the URL [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081)
