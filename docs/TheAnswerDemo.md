# The Answer Demonstration

Below are the instructions for using _The Answer_.

These instructions assume you have already followed the instructions detailed in [Install.md](Install.md) and either [VBoxTheAnswerInstall.md](VBoxTheAnswerInstall.md) if you are using the Virtual Box implementation, or [TheAnswerInstall.md](TheAnswerInstall.md) if you aren't. If you have not followed those instructions, do so now.

## Use _The Answer_

1. Type in a question and hit _Ask!_. The answer may take a while to appear (on some machines, it may take 5 minutes or more). Why is that?

## Examine the Front End Application

Change to _The Answer_ front end home directory `~/gitrepos/ExchangeCurrency/src/react-the-answer`.

Open the files `app/index.jsx`, `app/containers/answer.jsx` and `app/components/answer.jsx`. Do you understand the architecture of the application? Would you architect it that way? Why does the application use an event to get _The Answer_?
